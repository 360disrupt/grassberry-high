      <h2>The time with you is awesome...</h2>
      <p>...but Grassberry High is a hungry project, so you need to feed it.</p>
      <strong>If your time has run out, you will still be able to see everything but your outputs will not be switched anymore!</strong>
      <p class="hours-left"><span>{{timeLeftInHours}} hours left</span></p>

      <h2>Those are your options:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you haven't used your full trial yet, you can give feedback and extend your life up to 7 days each time you give feedback.</li>
        <li>If you are a contributor we will talk to the reaper for you. Not sure what to do, drop us an email.</li>
        <li>You can support the project financial.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>It costs just a lot to build something great and we want to stay as independent as possible. Help us and it will come back to you üëç.</strong></em></p>
